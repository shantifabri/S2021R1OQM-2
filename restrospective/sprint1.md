* For the last 2 stories (technically 3) shown on the table, we didn’t really plan to get them done during this sprint more than the frontend template.

* Hours per task:
  * average: 2.7hrs
  * standard deviation: 2.89

* Total task estimation error ratio: 0.85

## QUALITY MEASURES

* Unit Testing

For everything related to unit testing, we didn’t make it a task on it’s own. This phase was included in the tasks regarding the implementation of the stories. We now realize that it may be a good idea to separate them from each other to have a clearer analysis.

In this sprint, we couldn’t really get to doing the unit tests, and this is something we have pending. The reason for this being mainly time and the learning curve of using a framework new to most of us, that we had to learn before starting to code, and learning how to do good tests was an extra step we underestimated. Additionally, we had some personal situations that made time extra tight.

* E2E Testing

For this sprint, we didn’t plan on doing any E2E testing, for this reason, the total of hours estimated were 0. We didn’t work on this on the fly either so hours spent are also 0.

* Code Review

For the case of code reviewing, we didn’t specifically make it a task on itself so it wasn’t represented as a card on the board. Regardless, we all came to the agreement that every person should spend some time around half an hour to an hour at most doing code review, either to approve a peer’s PR or to review the final product of what is in the main branch in search of bugs or mistakes. For future sprints, we will consider making this process a card on itself.

* Technical Debt Management

As the project was just starting, and with it also being quite simple, we didn’t have any specific tasks regarding technical debt management. Now, we will re-review everything that's been done to check if there’s any new technical debt. So far, we know that we have some testing pending, but nothing regarding remediation.

## ASSESSMENT

* What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The story we’ve chosen had errors in estimation since we didn’t consider the initial setup. We needed a bit more time to be safe and reviewing everything without rushing, but fortunately we did a nice job.

* What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

We learnt that organization and task division was fundamental in this project and thanks to that we managed to accomplish all the stories that we planned to achieve for this sprint. A key part during the start of a project is knowledge sharing which allows everyone to be able to collaborate in the project.

* Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

We improved our team-working skills and organization, plus everyone learnt something new when sharing knowledges.

* Which ones were you not able to achieve? Why?

There’s no particular goal that we set at the beginning and that we didn’t reach during this sprint, but this of course doesn’t mean that there’s nothing we can improve, we still have a lot of progress to do both in regards to our personal skills and also regarding the team management. We only needed a bit more time to pass the unit tests.

* Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

We should try to better divide the tasks in order to finish the sprint some time before the deadline in order to discuss all together about the results and to deal with eventual bugs and issues.

* One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We can be proud of the degree of cooperation we achieved on different tasks, in spite of the fact that we all had a pretty different set of skills and different levels of background experience working in team to begin with; everyone tried his best to be open to every new idea and to any kind of question that arose and it was cool to see the effort made by those who were more experienced towards those of us who struggled a bit at the beginning.
